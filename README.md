  If you are looking for Kosmos, this is Kosmos' safer and way more extended evolution.
  If you are a current Kosmos user, you need Kosmos 2!


Info:
  Kosmos 2 includes all required sigpatches for Atmosphere + Hekate.
  
  It also includes a few other goodies such as patched tinfoil which bypasses hekate check
  along with support for blawar's incognito.


How-to guide:

  Step zero:
  copy files to SD CARD, launch payload.bin from root of SD.
 
  Step one:
  set up emunand on hidden partition in SX OS (hold vol+ after selecting SX OS in hekate),
  copy files back to sd card afterwards.

  Step two:
  boot into emummc through hekate and install incognito (SX OS or Atmosphere works for this) to prevent bans
  (you may use 90DNS if you like).
