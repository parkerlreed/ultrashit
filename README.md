If you are a current Ultrasphere user, you need Ultrasphere Reloaded!

## Features
* Vanilla Atmosphere
* All required sigpatches for Atmosphere + Hekate.
* SX OS
* Up-to-date packages
* Splash screens and instant launch
* Background FTP-Server
* Drag and drop
* A very handsome bootlogo by Team Xecuter and GaryOPA
* The latest and best homebrew from blawar

* **and much more!**

## How to use
1.) Back up your sdcard (Nintendo folder) if you are setting up emunand.

2.) Copy files to sdcard, launch payload.bin from root of SD.

3.) Set up emunand on hidden partition in SX OS (hold vol+ after selecting SX OS in hekate), copy files back to sd card afterwards.

4.) Boot into emunand through hekate and install incognito (SX OS or Atmosphere works for this) to prevent bans.
